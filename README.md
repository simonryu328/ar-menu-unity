## Introduction
Ordering food at a restaurant as a large group is a daunting task: Itâ€™s not easy for everyone to communicate what they want, or even know what they want if the dishes are unfamiliar to them. With current paper and digital menus that are using only texts to describe the menu, people do not get to see the accurate representations of the dishes. 

Sponsored by the Engineering Physics Lab, the goal of this project is to streamline the process of ordering shared food for large groups of people eating together at a restaurant. Using Augmented Reality (AR) technology and cloud services, our app goes beyond the simple display of menu items by allowing users to visualize and interact with virtual food models in a real-time, dynamically shared environment.
